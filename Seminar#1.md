# Seminar #1

###### June 25th 2023



## Abstract

In this seminar, our main focus will be on understanding and attempting to implement the theories and code from **Christopher Bishop**'s seminal work, **"Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning." **During the first seminar, we have established the schedule for presentations and assigned tasks to each group.

## Presentations

- Presentation Schedule: Twice a week, on Thursday and Sunday evenings from 19:30 to 21:30.

- Number of Presenters: Each group consists of two people, responsible for understanding the content and implementing or simulating the algorithms.

> "The purpose of forming groups is to allow everyone to work with their research partners, check and learn from each other. Additionally, we have considered that delivering multiple consecutive presentations can be exhausting for an individual, so we need to rotate the groups for presentations. Furthermore, for tasks involving shared reading, it is important not to neglect them just because it is not one's turn. Instead, based on the assigned tasks and responsibilities of each student, time and effort should be allocated appropriately, considering differences in depth and quality." -- Peiyu Tsai
